: '
Plots the density of states as a function of energy. Secondary variable adds multiple curves to a single figure.

max_energy		: absolute value of the maximum energy displayed in the x-axis in the plot
energy_res		: density of the data points in the plot

Valid arguments for the secondary_variable are:

phase			: phase difference between the superconductors in the units of pi
alpha_i			: magnitude of the Rashba coupling constant with
				  A = (alpha_1 sigma_x + alpha_2 sigma_z, 0, alpha_3 sigma_x + alpha_4 sigma_z)
exchange		: magnitude of the exchange field in the units of Thouless energy
exchange_angle	: angle of the exchange field with h = cos(x) sigma_z + sin(x) sigma_x

Note that even if you defined "exchange" as a primary_variable, you must give a value also for the variable "exchange" below. This does not effect the actual figure, but is required for all the parameters for technical reasons. This is true for all primary and secondary variables.

User must also define:

delta 			: superconducting order parameter
legend_location	: location of the legend in the plot ("none" is also a valid option)
text_location	: location of the text where all the fixed variables are listed ("none" is also a valid option)
suppress_zeros	: do not write down some fixed parameters wiht zero value into to figure
dashed_line		: Draws a dashed line along y=0 if True and does not draw it if "False".
y_min=0.00		: The minimum and maximum of the y-axis in the figure. Give y_min=0.00 
y_max=1.80		: and y_max=0.00 to use dynamical scaling on the y-axis.

User defined directories:

RES_DIR			: directory there the results are stored (make sure this is the same as in the run script dos)
FIG_DIR 		: directory where the created figure is stored

# If "alphas", writes only the non-zero alphas into the text in the figure. If "h_angle", do not write the exchange field angle into the figure if it is zero. If "both", both of the previous apply. If "False", write all parameters regardless the value.
